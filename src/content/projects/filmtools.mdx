## Overview

I worked across the full stack to help design, build, and maintain the Filmtools website, supporting both the technical platform and day-to-day business needs. My work included frontend and backend development, performance optimization, and improving Core Web Vitals to enhance site speed and user experience. I built and maintained custom features and modules, and regularly supported marketing campaigns by creating and updating landing pages, managing product and page content, and assisting with promotions. I also handled importing and exporting product data to ensure accurate, timely updates across the catalog, following best practices to keep the platform stable, scalable, and easy to maintain.
