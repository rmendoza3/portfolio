## Overview

I designed and built my personal portfolio website from the ground up to showcase my work, skills, and ongoing learning as a self-taught developer. The site is built with Next.js and React, with Tailwind CSS for styling, and focuses on performance, accessibility, and clean, responsive design. I used modern frontend best practices, component-based architecture, and SEO-friendly patterns to create a fast, maintainable site that can evolve as my experience and projects grow.
